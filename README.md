# Bunny-My-News 

This is the code for my Chrome extension

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bunny-my-news/hejjhgihcmepiacbeomcjgmgopkhmaak

that replaces images of Donald Trump with bunnies. 

Please feel free to copy / edit / reuse the code in any way you like, but please do not use my hosted images - I have to pay the S3 bill each month ;) 

To use your own images, simply edit bmn.js. Thanks.
